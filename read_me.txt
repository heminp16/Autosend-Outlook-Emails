Notes:
* Make sure the excel file has a column named "Worker Email" or it will not work. 
* Must be an excel file
* Make sure you keep the emailBody.txt file, or else the app will not work. 

How to edit the email body:
* In the emailBody.txt, you can see bunch of comments in the file. Those are there to remind you of the variables the code will extract and replace. 
  If they bother you, you can delete those comments, just remember the variables are {DATESUBJECT} and {SIGNATURE}
* However, these comments will never be sent out to the workers, so they can stay in the text file.
